practical writeup:

o create a simple mobile website using jQuery Mobile framework that is responsive and mobile-friendly.

🧩 Software/Tools Required:

Web Browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

Text Editor (VS Code / Sublime / Notepad++)

Internet connection (for jQuery Mobile CDN)

🧱 Theory:

jQuery Mobile is a framework built on top of the jQuery library designed to simplify the creation of responsive, touch-friendly web pages for smartphones and tablets.
It provides:

Pre-styled UI components (buttons, lists, dialogs)

Responsive design

Page navigation system

Theming and transitions
☁️ Deployment / Hosting (AWS)
1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

Go to AWS Management Console
.

Select Elastic Beanstalk → Create New Application.

Choose Web Server Environment.

Upload your HTML file in a .zip folder.

Deploy and access the provided AWS URL.

2. AWS S3 (Static Hosting):

Create an S3 bucket.

Enable Static Website Hosting.

Upload your .html file.

Copy the Public URL to access your hosted site
In this practical, we successfully created a mobile-friendly website using the jQuery Mobile framework.
The website demonstrates the use of multiple pages within a single HTML file, smooth page navigation, responsive design, and mobile-optimized UI components such as buttons, headers, footers, and list views.

Through this experiment, we learned how jQuery Mobile simplifies web development for mobile devices by providing built-in UI themes, transitions, and touch-friendly controls.
Finally, by deploying the website on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk or S3), we understood how to host and make the mobile website accessible online — completing both the development and deployment process of a modern web application.
